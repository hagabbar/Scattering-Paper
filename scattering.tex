\section{Introduction}
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of two identical 4 kilometer long interferometric detectors located in Hanford, Washington (H1) and Livingston, Louisiana (L1). The detectors are Michelson interferometers with Fabry-Perot resonant cavity arms [\textbf{need ref here}]. Each detector has a 200 W Nd-YAG laser (\textbf{This may be wrong?}) that is sent through the interferometer and test-mass mirrors. These test-mass mirrors are seismically isolated using a multi-stage suspension system. The core optics are located in an ultra-high vacuum system. [\textbf{Cite virgo paper here?}]

\par Recently, LIGO completed the first half of its second observation run (referred to as O2) \textbf{Should I give dates here?}. Over the course of this observation period, there were many noise sources that were modeled and characterized. One such noise source, scattering, was intermittent over the course of the analysis period.  Scattering is the result of diffused light scattering inside the vacuum system. Diffused light can additionally result from light scattered off of optics located on benches outside the vacuum system, which can introduce noise.

\section{Deep Learning}

The inspiration for deep learning stems from the archetecture and mechanisms by which the human brain functions. To understand this, let us consider the world's simplest neural network, a single perceptron node. In a single perceptron node a set of variables we'll call, $x_{1}, x_{2}, ... x_{n}$, denotes a set of numerical features that describe an input sample set. Each feature is multiplied by an initially randomized weight vector of the same size and dimension as the feautre. An additional bias term is added (typically either $+1$ or $-1$) in order gurantee that there will always be  a constant term in the output (\textbf{Need to describe the bias better!}).

% If in two-column mode, this environment will change to single-column
% format so that long equations can be displayed. Use
% sparingly.
%\begin{widetext}
% put long equation here
%\end{widetext}

% figures should be put into the text as floats.
% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e)
% and the \includegraphics macro defined in those packages.
% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz,
% and Frank Mittelbach for instance.
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the
% entire page. There is no need to do explicit centering.

% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{}%
% \caption{\label{}}
% \end{figure}

% Surround figure environment with turnpage environment for landscape
% figure
% \begin{turnpage}
% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{}%
% \caption{\label{}}
% \end{figure}
% \end{turnpage}

% tables should appear as floats within the text
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the
% \begin{tabular}{} command.
% The ruledtabular enviroment adds doubled rules to table and sets a
% reasonable default table settings.
% Use the table* environment to get a full-width table in two-column
% Add \usepackage{longtable} and the longtable (or longtable*}
% environment for nicely formatted long tables. Or use the the [H]
% placement option to break a long table (with less control than 
% in longtable).
% \begin{table}%[H] add [H] placement to break table across pages
% \caption{\label{}}
% \begin{ruledtabular}
% \begin{tabular}{}
% Lines of table here ending with \\
% \end{tabular}
% \end{ruledtabular}
% \end{table}

% Surround table environment with turnpage environment for landscape
